# Readme

This is a graphical frontend for the Unix `traceroute` utility. It displays the geographic locations to which a URL is resolved. 

It has been written using the Processing API. These librariers were also used: GLGraphics, toxiclibs and controlP5.

Requirements are:

 * `traceroute`
 * `dig`
 * Java

**Project Status:** I have written this application five years ago and haven't done much work on it since. The application should still work under a Unix system (at the time I tested it under Linux and Mac OS X) with a decent Java version.

I also uploaded a short video to [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/26674070).


# Known Issues

Some bugs left and I want to resolve the `dig` dependency.
Known issue: Loading bar vanishes after first station.


# How to start the application?

You can either import everything as an Eclipse project, adjust the Build path and do `Run As > Java Applet` or you can use the standalone version:

	tar -xf standalone.tar.gz 
	cd standalone/
	ln -s ../geoip geoip
	java -Djava.library.path=./library -jar trace.jar


# Maps

The textures are taken from the [NASA's Blue Marble project](https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=57723). 


# GeoIP

The GeoIP lookup is done using a GeoIP database:
